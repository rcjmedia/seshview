Built for nodeknockout.com hackathon. Worked alone for 2 days and was not able to submit on time due to difficulties in socket.io and YouTube API but I was able to fix the issues after the submission date.

The video will sync together. For example, if you play, pause or stop the video, it's going to do the same to others, or if your friends/co-worker does the same thing.

To get started, create a Room where you'll enter the YouTube URL.

Once the Room is created, click on the Room title and share the Room URL to your friends, co-worker, etc.

Enjoy!
